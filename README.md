# Game Dev Final Project Ideas

## Dungeon Puzzle Box:
-Small top down 2d game that plays like the original zelda
-Quick to pick up, easy to understand because of familiar mechanics, cute
-Simple gameplay hides depth. Meta puzzles and challenges make the game “puzzle box” esque
-Fast game to finish, speedrun potential?
-Inspired by Minit, Disc Room, pico 8 games

## RTS but dice people:
-Okay here me out, your units in an RTS are little dice people, and you move/make them attack by rolling them. The number they roll could affect the outcome of an action. Different types of dice could do different things, or just be better (Round dice roll! Or it hurts to step on a D4).
-Player versus monsters, or very simple AI
-Adding depth -  scratching off numbers? Make numbers on a die do something special?

## Pirate Advencharr:
-Small management game where you control a tiny pirate ship that sails the seas to obtain treasure and fame
-Control your ship’s layout and crew members, encounters play out as a sort of cross section RTS
-Procedural generation of islands?
-Inspired by pixel pirates?

## Asteroid Exploration:
-2D exploration based platformer that takes place on a small belt of asteroids
-Mario galaxy style gravity, use a jetpack to jump between worlds.
-Meat of the challenges take place inside asteroid caves
-Inspired by cave story, outer wilds?
-Alt setting: floating pyramids?

## Crafting Fortifications
-Isometric block based game where you defend against enemies by making a fortress out of defensive block
-Tower/wave defense. Use special blocks to make creative traps for enemies
-You control a character during the day who can move blocks, but then just watch how it works at night


## Interests:
-Multiplayer Networking: I’ve been dabbling in this using unity for my internship, it would be fun to make a server based game for this class as well!
-Simple but polished main mechanics: With time limitations I’d rather make something small and polished than bloated and unfinished
-Retro/gameboy inspired aesthetic
-Shader tinkering
